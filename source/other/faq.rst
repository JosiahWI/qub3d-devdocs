==============================

Why this FAQ?
--------------

This file tries to answer questions before they're
asked. This can save time and trouble of asking them and/or
the trouble of encountering a problem. This can significantly
reduce traffic in the issue/question-tracking boards. This
can be useful for both you and the Qub3d Engine Group.


What is Qub3d's goal?
----------------------

Its goal is to be an independent, free, and open source voxel
game that is actually *fun* while taking inspiration from
Minetest and Minecraftâ„¢. For more information in regards
to this, see `the wiki article about it <https://phab.qub3d.org/w/project_goals>`_.


What's Phabricator?
--------------------

Phabricator is a collaborative Task Managing/Source
Code Hosting platform that lags behind Github in terms
of popularity. It is the development platform in use
by the Qub3d Engine Group.


How do I create a Phabricator account?
---------------------------------------

Go to `our Phabricator <https://phab.qub3d.org>`_ and
register your account there with Github. If you don't have
a Github account, then make one. It's free and grants you access
to most of the Open Source development community. To register your
account, look for :guilabel:`Log In or Register (GitHub)` and click on it.


How is "Qub3d" pronounced?
---------------------------

It has the exact same pronounciation as "cubed" with a hard
"c" and the English standard for the suffix "-ed." To put this in
other "words," it is pronounced as "k-you-bd." The "3" in
"Qub3d" is pronounced "cubed" as well.


Where do I report bugs?
------------------------

We take bugs very seriously. You can report bugs/issues at
`Maniphest <https://phab.qub3d.org/maniphest>`_ after registering an

Where can I find more information about Qub3d?
-----------------------------------------------

Much of the official Qub3d documentation can be found on
`the official wiki <https://phab.qub3d.org/w/>`_.


When will it be done? Why is it taking so long?
------------------------------------------------

It all has to do with the nature of the software.
See `Why Is It Taking So Long??!? <https://phab.qub3d.org/u/takingsolong>`_.
