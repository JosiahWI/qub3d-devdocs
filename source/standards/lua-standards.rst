This file is dedicated to Lua format
standards provided by the Qub3d Engine Group.


Format Standards
==============================


Localization
-------------

The code must be written in ASCII.
We use the English ASCII localization standard for
writing Lua. Strings may be in unicode, preferably
UTF-8, unless you insert a unicode character that
ASCII doesn't support. For more information
on which characters are supported by ASCII, see
`the tables <http://www.asciitable.com/>`_.
