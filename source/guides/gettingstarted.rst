Welcome to the Official Qub3d Getting Started Guide!

This file is dedicated to getting started
in general with the Qub3d Engine Group.

The simplest way to get started with Qub3d is to join
the `official Discord Server <https://discord.gg/yv7FN24>`_.
We also have an official IRC channel on freenode: #qub3d.
If you have any issues that just don't quite fit inside
Discord or IRC, don't fret! We have an official email address:
y​o​@​q​u​b​3​d​.​o​r​g where you can send questions that don't
contain spam/inappropriate/irrelevant content. This email
is *only* used for questions regarding the Qub3d Engine
Group.

There are other guides/howtos that go beyond this guide
in some fields, such as the Contributors' Guide
and the Documentation Howto. This guide is just
to help you get ready for getting our hands dirty
with the Qub3d repositories.

The aim of this guide is to familiarize new users to
the Qub3d Engine Group and its tools. In this guide,
we give a brief introduction on each tool used in the
Qub3d project, and the Qub3d Engine Group and all of its
participating members. If you appreciate this project
enough to contribute, then please read the
Contributors' Guide.
